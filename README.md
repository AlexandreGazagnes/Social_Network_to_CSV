# Social_Network_to_CSV_v1.0
You are a recruiter, you are very sad about copying and pasting the results of your search on excel, google spredsheet or worst... in Word! This little program his here to help you. No worry about APIs or Scientific tools. this is a very simple progam to help you dealing with the result of yours search



first file added is search_result_lkd_premium.
it is a library to translate, copy/paste data from a lkd premimum search with recruiter_tool (not just premium) to a csv file.
it could be used as a standable program of course, but it has to be integrated to a main.py


This this fist library can be easily update : 
  - lots of cleaning before processing ("Plus", "12 Relations", "Enregistrer dans un projet") it coul be  great accelator for the program speed --- > OK ? 
  - Bunch of code can be factorised, for exemple the separtors "job - Company", or "Fomation - year"...
  etc etc
  - few bugs have to be corected in the current algo
  - make a standable programm
  
  
average rate speed 13 000 ko/s


NEXT MAIN STEPS : 
  - validate and check various config for the toom
  - continue to lkd with : 
    - lkd recruiter projet
    - lkd recruiter search tool (not result)
    - lkd free search
    - lkd premiuum searc result
    - Viadeo 
    - Xing
