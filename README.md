# Social_Network_to_CSV_v1.0
You are a recruiter, you are very sad about copying and pasting the results of your search on excel, google spredsheet or worst... in Word! This little program his here to help you. No worry about APIs or Scientific tools. this is a very simple progam to help you dealing with the result of yours search



first file added is search_result_linkedin_premium.
it is a library to translate, copy/paste data from a linkedin premimum search with recruiter_tool (not just premium) to a csv file.
it could be used as a standable program of course, but it has to be integrated to a main.py


This this fist library can be easily update : 
  - lots of cleaning before processing ("Plus", "12 Relations", "Enregistrer dans un projet") it coul be  great accelator for the program speed
  - Bunch of code can be factorised, for exemple the separtors "job - Company", or "Fomation - year"...
  etc etc
  -  IT IS LINKEDIN RECRUITER AND NOT PREMUIM !!!!
  - few bugs have to be corected in the current algo
  - make a standable programm
  
NEXT MAIN STEPS : 
  - validate and check various config for the toom
  - continue to linkedin with : 
    - linkedin recruiter projet
    - linkedin recruiter search tool (not result)
    - viadeo 
    - Xing 
    - etc etc
